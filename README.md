Customer Segmentation using Clustering (Mall Customers Dataset)


## Overview
This project applies **Unsupervised Learning** to segment mall customers into distinct groups 
for targeted marketing strategies. I used **KMeans** with dimensionality 
reduction techniques like **PCA**.

Dataset: [Mall Customers Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vjchoudhary7/customer-segmentation-tutorial-in-python)


## Methods
- Preprocessing with `StandardScaler`
- Clustering with `KMeans` 
- Dimensionality reduction with `PCA`
- Evaluation using **Elbow Method**, **Silhouette Score**
